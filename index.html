  <h3>People around the world face violence and inequality—and sometimes torture, even execution—because of who they
    love, how they look, or who they are. Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of our selves and
    should never lead to discrimination or abuse. Human Rights Watch works for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
    peoples' rights, and with activists representing a multiplicity of identities and issues. We document and expose
    abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity worldwide, including torture, killing and executions, arrests
    under unjust laws, unequal treatment, censorship, medical abuses, discrimination in health and jobs and housing,
    domestic violence, abuses against children, and denial of family rights and recognition.</h3>
